ncdc

Retrieve data from the National Climatic Data Center.

ncdc is intended to be a simple R package that retrieves data from the National
Climatic Data Center (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). This package is under "not so
active" development, thus updates are infrequent and intermittent at
best. Currently only ASOS one minute and ISD-Lite data are retrievable.

ASOS one minute ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/asos-onemin/README.TXT
ISD-Lite ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/isd-lite-format.txt

Data access may be restricted by organization and/or location. The authors and
maintainers of ncdc assume no responsibility for the use or misuse of ncdc.
